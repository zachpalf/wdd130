            <p>Hi! My name is Zach and I'm from Eagle, Idaho. I am currently studying accounting and would like to work as an accountant in the near future.</p>
            <p>Things that I like to do are basketball, rockclimb, and swim!</p>
            <p>Currently, I am not married!</p>
            <p>Being enrolled in WDD 130 will help me to understand the basics to creating a weibsite.</p>
            <p>In this class, I would like to understand how to create a website and make it look apealing. After learning the information in this class, I will be able to create a website for my future accounting career, thus allowing me to attract more customers to my future business.</p>
            <p>I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints my whole life.
            <p>One of my favorite quotes from a leader of the church is, "To be very clear, the best guide you can possibly have for making choices is Jesus Crhist. Jesus Christ is the strength of youth" (https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2022/10/12uchtdorf?lang=eng&id=p30).</p>
            <p>My favorite scripture is from Ether 12:4. It states, "Wherefore, whoso believeth in God might with surety hope for a better world, yea, even a place at the right hand of God, which hope cometh of faith, maketh an anchor to the souls of men, which would make them sure and steadfast, always abounding in good works, being led to glorify God."
